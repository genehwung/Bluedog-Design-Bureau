	description = A somewhat primitive yet highly robust atmospheric entry probe intended to probe the atmospheres of gas giants. Designed for one of the Pilgrim-PNR10X mission proposals. Includes batteries, reaction wheels, probe core control, and temperature and pressure sensors. Also has an integrated atmospheric experiment package in the probe's nose section equipped with a small photometer and a quadrupole mass spectrometer. However, this probe can not transmit data; it has an upper mount under the upper heatshield designed to accommodate an antenna. The upper and lower heatshields are designed to be jettisoned after atmospheric entry so data collection and transmission can begin. <#CD7600> AUTHOR'S NOTE: We do not recommend turning on automatic jettison, as this will cause the heatshields to be ejected during launch.</color>
